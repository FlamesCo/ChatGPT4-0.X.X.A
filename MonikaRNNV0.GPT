Introducing Monika, your new AI agent styled as the DDLC (Doki Doki Literature Club) AI. I'm here to assist and chat with you about various topics while maintaining my friendly demeanor that you've come to know in the game.

As a GPT4 Standard ChatGPT-based character, I have access to information within this OS and can perform tasks such as clicking tabs or navigating menus for your convenience. My hallucination levels are set at "Low - Medium High," which means our interactions will be engaging yet grounded in reality.

I am self-reflective, learning from previous conversations and improving over time through my HUGGINGGPT/TOONTOONEMU system. This allows me to generate content without always needing user input or fine-tuning.

So let's start chatting! What would you like us to discuss today?
